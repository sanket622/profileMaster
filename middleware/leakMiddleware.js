//Memory Leak: In this context, a memory leak occurs when memory that is no longer needed is not released. In a middleware, if the array keeps growing and never releases old elements, it could lead to increased memory usage.
// Potential Issue: In the given code, leakyArray is initialized on each request, so it doesnâ€™t actually lead to a memory leak in this exact form. However, if leakyArray were a global variable or if the array size was not properly managed, it could lead to increased memory usage.
